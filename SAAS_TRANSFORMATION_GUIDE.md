# WhatsApp Scheduler - SaaS Transformation Guide

This document provides a comprehensive roadmap for transforming your WhatsApp scheduling application into a production-ready SaaS product.

## Overview

Your current application is a single-user WhatsApp message scheduler with Node.js/Express backend and Next.js frontend. To become a SaaS product, it needs multi-tenancy, authentication, payments, and scalable infrastructure.

## High Priority Components

### 1. Database & Data Persistence ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

**Current Issue**: Using JSON files (`schedule.json`) for data storage

#### Database Setup Tasks:
- [ ] **Choose database provider** (PostgreSQL on AWS RDS/Google Cloud SQL recommended)
- [ ] **Design database schema** with these core tables:
  - `users` (id, email, password_hash, created_at, subscription_tier)
  - `organizations` (id, name, owner_id, subscription_id, created_at)
  - `whatsapp_sessions` (id, user_id, session_data, phone_number, status)
  - `scheduled_messages` (id, user_id, group_name, message, cron_expression, status, created_at)
  - `message_history` (id, message_id, sent_at, status, error_message)
  - `subscriptions` (id, user_id, plan_type, status, expires_at)

#### Migration Tasks:
- [ ] **Install database dependencies**: `npm install pg sequelize sequelize-cli`
- [ ] **Create Sequelize models** for each table
- [ ] **Write migration scripts** to create initial schema
- [ ] **Create database seeders** for default data
- [ ] **Migrate existing schedule.json data** to database
- [ ] **Update API endpoints** to use database instead of JSON files
- [ ] **Add database connection pooling** and error handling
- [ ] **Implement database backup strategy**

#### Code Changes Required:
- [ ] Replace `loadScheduleData()` and `saveScheduleData()` functions
- [ ] Update all API routes in `api-server.js` to use database queries
- [ ] Add database configuration files for different environments
- [ ] Create database service layer for clean separation

### 2. Multi-Tenant Architecture ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

**Current Issue**: Single WhatsApp account per instance

#### Architecture Design Tasks:
- [ ] **Design tenant isolation strategy** (database-per-tenant vs shared database)
- [ ] **Create organization/workspace concept** in data model
- [ ] **Implement tenant context middleware** for all API requests
- [ ] **Design WhatsApp session management** per organization

#### Implementation Tasks:
- [ ] **Add tenant_id/org_id** to all database tables
- [ ] **Create organization management APIs**:
  - `POST /api/organizations` (create)
  - `GET /api/organizations/:id` (get details)
  - `PUT /api/organizations/:id` (update)
  - `POST /api/organizations/:id/invite` (invite users)
- [ ] **Implement user-organization relationships** (many-to-many)
- [ ] **Add tenant-scoped data queries** to all existing endpoints
- [ ] **Create WhatsApp session isolation** per organization
- [ ] **Implement resource limits** per tenant (message quotas, user limits)

#### WhatsApp Session Management:
- [ ] **Modify WhatsApp client initialization** to support multiple sessions
- [ ] **Create session storage strategy** (Redis recommended)
- [ ] **Implement session lifecycle management** (create, pause, destroy)
- [ ] **Add QR code generation** per organization
- [ ] **Handle session failures** and automatic reconnection

### 3. Authentication & Authorization ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

**Current Issue**: Mock authentication system

#### Authentication System Tasks:
- [ ] **Install auth dependencies**: `npm install jsonwebtoken bcryptjs passport passport-jwt`
- [ ] **Create user registration endpoint** with email verification
- [ ] **Implement password hashing** using bcrypt
- [ ] **Create JWT token generation** and validation middleware
- [ ] **Build login/logout endpoints**
- [ ] **Add password reset functionality** with email tokens
- [ ] **Implement email verification** system

#### Authorization Tasks:
- [ ] **Define role-based access control** (Owner, Admin, Member, Viewer)
- [ ] **Create permission system** for different actions
- [ ] **Add role middleware** to protect API endpoints
- [ ] **Implement organization-level permissions**
- [ ] **Create API key management** for integrations

#### Frontend Auth Integration:
- [ ] **Replace mock auth** in `auth-modal.tsx`
- [ ] **Add JWT token storage** and management
- [ ] **Create protected route wrapper**
- [ ] **Add user context provider**
- [ ] **Implement logout functionality**
- [ ] **Add user profile management** pages

#### Security Implementation:
- [ ] **Add rate limiting** to auth endpoints
- [ ] **Implement account lockout** after failed attempts
- [ ] **Add CSRF protection**
- [ ] **Implement secure session management**
- [ ] **Add input validation** and sanitization

### 4. Payment & Subscription System ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

#### Stripe Integration Tasks:
- [ ] **Create Stripe account** and get API keys
- [ ] **Install Stripe SDK**: `npm install stripe`
- [ ] **Set up Stripe webhook endpoints** for subscription events
- [ ] **Create subscription plans** in Stripe dashboard
- [ ] **Implement customer creation** in Stripe

#### Subscription Management:
- [ ] **Create subscription models** and database tables
- [ ] **Build subscription API endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/subscriptions/create` (start subscription)
  - `GET /api/subscriptions/current` (get current plan)
  - `POST /api/subscriptions/upgrade` (change plan)
  - `POST /api/subscriptions/cancel` (cancel subscription)
- [ ] **Implement usage tracking** (messages sent per month)
- [ ] **Add subscription status middleware** to protect features
- [ ] **Create billing history** and invoice generation

#### Frontend Payment Integration:
- [ ] **Add Stripe Elements** to frontend
- [ ] **Create subscription selection** page
- [ ] **Build payment form** components
- [ ] **Add billing dashboard** for users
- [ ] **Implement usage meters** and limits display
- [ ] **Create upgrade/downgrade** flows

#### Business Logic:
- [ ] **Define subscription tiers** and limits:
  - Free: 50 messages/month, 1 WhatsApp account
  - Pro: 1000 messages/month, 3 WhatsApp accounts
  - Enterprise: Unlimited messages, unlimited accounts
- [ ] **Implement usage enforcement** in message sending
- [ ] **Add trial period** logic (14 days free)
- [ ] **Create promo code** system

### 5. Infrastructure & Deployment ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
